* The [VCC CLI](https://vcc.docs.vrchat.com/vpm/cli)

You can also [track Packages](https://github.com/vrchat-community/creator-companion/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&template=package-upgrade-request.md&title=%5BPACKAGE%5D+) that are not yet compatible with the [VPM](https://vcc.docs.vrchat.com/vpm/) so other creators can know about the issues, and the creators of those packages and prefabs can fix them and inform everyone.

We are migrating our main Docs here as well, so that you can contribute suggestions and changes.
